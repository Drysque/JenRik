# JenRik

JenRik is a simple but powerfull testing script.

The main idea was to write a generic binary testing script.\
JenRik simply parse a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
file containing the tests and run them.

## Installation

#### Dependencies:
The only dependency is the python parser for toml. Install it with:
```
pip install toml
```

#### Installation from sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yohannfra/JenRik
cd JenRik
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Quick Start

##### Let's say we need to test this basic python script.

my_prog.py :
```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    print("No arguments given")
    exit(1)
else:
    print(sys.argv)
```

##### First we need to init a test file for our my_prog.py

```bash
$ jenerik init ./my_prog.py # you must give the path and not just the binary name
```

It will create a *test_my_prog.toml* file with this content:
```toml
binary_path = "my_prog.py"

# A sample test
[test1]
args = ["-h"]
status = 0
stdout=""
stderr=""

```

The first line ```binary_path = "my_prog.py"``` indicates the path to the binary to test.

The line ```[test1]``` define a test and the following values are parts of it:
```toml
args = ["-h"] # the command line arguments
status = 0    # the expected exit status
stdout=""     # the expected stdout (not tested if empty)
stderr=""     # the expected stderr (not tested if empty)
```

âš  Each test require at least the args and status values !

stdout and stderr can be omitted.


If you want more examples on how to write tests you should see this [file](test_JenRik.toml)

## USAGE
Once you have written the test file you just have to :
```
jenerik test_my_prog.toml
```

## Roadmap
- Add the possibility to diff the output with an existing file
- Add a pre and a post command
